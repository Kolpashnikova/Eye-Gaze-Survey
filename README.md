## Datasets
A comparison of gaze datasets with respect to several attributes (i.e. number of subjects (\# subjects), gaze labels, modality, headpose and gaze angle in yaw and pitch axis, environment (Env.), baseline method, data statistics (\# of data), and year of publication.) The abbreviations used are: In: Indoor, Out: Outdoor, Both: Indoor + Outdoor, Gen.: Generation, u/k: unknown, Seq.: Sequence, VF: Visual Field, EB: Eye Blink, GE: Gaze Event, GBRT: Gradient Boosting Regression Trees, GC: Gaze Communication, GNN: Graph Neural Network and Seg.: Segmentation.

## Gaze Analysis Methods
A comparison of gaze analysis methods with respect to registration (Reg.), representation (Represent.), Level of Supervision, Model, Prediction, validation on benchmark datasets (validation), Platforms, Publication venue (Publ.) and year. Here, GV: Gaze Vector, Scr.: Screen, LOSO: Leave One Subject Out, LPIPS: Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity, MM: Morphable Model, RRF: Random Regression Forest, AEM: Anatomic Eye Model, GRN: Gaze Regression Network, ET: External Target, FV: Free Viewing, HH: HandHeld Device, HMD: Head Mounted Device, Seg.: Segmentation and GR: Gaze Redirection, LAEO: Looking At Each Other.
